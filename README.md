My name is Nicholas Knight, and I am 35 years of age. I am a proud Australian, born in Hobart, Tasmania. I am a Catholic, and I’m very family oriented.  There are 2 very important females in my life at present, my mum, my 9-year-old daughter, Sophie.  My mum means the world to me, I have been in and out of hospital quite regularly in recent years and she has been there for me all the way.
Quite recently, I had an accident which resulted in me having an acquired brain injury. It happened 3 years ago now. It is a hypoxic brain injury, which basically means my brain was starved of oxygen for an amount of time, enough so that caused permanent injury to my brain.  Without going into detail, it effects predominately my short-term memory.
I currently live in Brisbane, which for me, has both its ups and down sides. I am an AFL fanatic, and a loyal Hawthorn Hawks supporter. Brisbane has the GABBA ground, however, the Brisbane Lions only play the Hawks once a year here. I’m also not a fan of the humid heat during summer. I think that’s the Tasmanian in me coming out. 
Most of my education to date was down in Hobart.  I attended Geilston Bay High School where I completed year 10. I did also attend Rosny Bay High School to study year 11, however I was not able to complete the year.  After that, I enrolled with an online IT education provider called ‘Cottonsoft’ where I completed a several modules and a handful of assignments, but once again, personal issues interrupted, and my time was cut short. That is the currently the only formal education I have. I learned a lot about PC hardware and assembling systems, most of my knowledge was what I learned myself. I have been doing a lot of PC repairs and upgrades for various family members, and other locals in the community. I have a Facebook page and have played around with google ads, however, have never had a formal business as such because I haven’t yet obtained the required formal qualification.


Interest in IT?
I have had a HUGE interest in IT ever since I can remember. In high school information technology was my favourite subject. It was the only subject to be honest, I ever looked forward to attending. 
I had a great teacher that made studying interesting and fun which was rare for me.
And to be completely honest, it is the only sector I have ever seen myself working or being involved in. 
One of the most interesting things to me about IT is its growth. How fast IT evolves and changes on such a regular basis.
I am a bit of a geek, I find IT facts fascinating.
Facts such as ‘The very first computer being 2.5 meters high and weighing nearly 30,000kg’.  Or ‘The Apple II had a hard drive of only 5 megabytes when it was released, now we have hard drives as big as 60TB SSD.’ 
We now speak to our homes. ‘Tell’ our lights to turn on or off, to change colours. With google home and other innovative companies, technology is so interesting now and is forever changing.


RMIT offered me a chance to study what I enjoy, and what I hope to one day be doing as a paying job in the community. 

Why have I chosen to study at RMIT?
I have chosen to study at RMIT for several reasons.
RMIT (from what I have read), has a great reputation. particularly with their off campus, online study option. Like the slogan on the RMIT website says, study here, succeed anywhere. With RMIT I can gain a globally recognised IT qualification while studying at home and during hours that are available to me. Because of certain lifestyle restraints, I am currently unable to study on campus.
RMIT have a 5-Star QS ranking for excellence in higher education. Its ranked 21st in the world and 5th in Australia among universities less than 50 years old.
To me, if I get the chance to study at home, (the only place currently possible for me), and with the 250st ranked university in the entire world, (when there is nearly 30,000 in the world).  Being honest, A huge influence for me was the financial factor. RMIT accepted my method of payment (which was HECS). 
What do I expect to learn while studying with RMIT?
I expect to learn enough in a vast amount of IT areas to be employable as an IT professional. I realise further study may be required if I wish to be employed in certain jobs.
My Ideal Dream Job:
My ideal dream job is in the IT industry?
My ideal job would offer Opportunities, Variety, Growth, challenges, Money, Innovation, and end of the day satisfaction.  
A job that provides challenges and personal satisfaction. Money would be a factor, a wage that reflects on the effort I would have put in to get to my ideal job, as well as reflecting on the work I would be employed to do. A specialist role that requires a lot of IT knowledge.
Jobs such as Technical consultant, Systems Analyst, Information technology coordinator interest me so much. Personally, if I was employed in any of the above with good conditions, I would consider having my dream job. 

What do I hope to do after graduation?
After graduation I would like to, first, go on a nice holiday for a couple of weeks for 2 main reasons. The first is to celebrate graduating, a reward to myself for all the hard work and dedication. The second is to allow myself some time to help with my decision of what to do next. My two main options as I see them at present are:
